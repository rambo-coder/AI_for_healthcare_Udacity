Code for Udacity Nanodegree AI for Healthcare

1 - Chest X-Ray
In this project, I will apply the skills that you have acquired in this 2D medical imaging course to analyze data from the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset and train a CNN to classify a given chest x-ray for the presence or absence of pneumonia. This project will culminate in a model that can predict the presence of pneumonia with human radiologist-level accuracy that can be prepared for submission to the FDA for 510(k) clearance as software as a medical device. As part of the submission preparation, you will formally describe your model, the data that it was trained on, and a validation plan that meets FDA criteria.

2 - Hippocampal Volume 
I will build an end-to-end AI system which features a machine learning algorithm that integrates into a clinical-grade viewer and automatically measures hippocampal volumes of new patients, as their studies are committed to the clinical imaging archive.

3 - Patients selection for diabetes
I will build a regression model that can predict the estimated hospitalization time for a patient and also provide an uncertainty estimate range for that prediction so that you can rank the predictions based off of the uncertainty range.

Expected Hospitalization Time Regression and Uncertainty Estimation Model: Utilizing a synthetic dataset(upsampled, denormalized, with line level augmentation) built off of the UCI Diabetes readmission dataset, students will build a regression model that predicts the expected days of hospitalization time and an uncertainty range estimation.

4 - Motion Compensated Pulse rate
Develop a Pulse Rate Algorithm on the given training data. Then Test Your Algorithm and see that it has met the success criteria.
Apply the Pulse Rate Algorithm on a Clinical Application and compute more clinically meaningful features and discover healthcare trends.
